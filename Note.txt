Identify the taboo cells of a warehouse. A cell is called taboo if whenever
    a box get pushed on such a cell then the puzzle becomes unsolvable.
    When determining the taboo cells, you must ignore all the existing boxes,
    simply consider the walls and the target cells.
    Use only the following two rules to determine the taboo cells;
     Rule 1: if a cell is a corner and not a target, then it is a taboo cell.
     Rule 2: all the cells between two corners along a wall are taboo if none
             of these cells is a target.
